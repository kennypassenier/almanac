# Almanac

A Rust hub that receives events from other systems (task managers, home
automation, monitoring, AI sessions) and translates them into calendar
entries across purpose-specific Google Calendars — a single readable
plan-and-log for the household and the homelab.

This project follows the dev procedure in `~/Projects/dev-procedure/`
(`/project-flow`). Standing rules apply to every change:
`~/Projects/dev-procedure/STANDING_RULES.md`.
Enforcement is **git-native** (`.githooks/` via `core.hooksPath`), so
gates hold from any session or terminal. After a fresh clone, run:
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. (Not yet installed — lands in
Phase 5.)

## Procedure status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current phase | 6 · Development loop, milestone L3 next |
| Last completed gate | L2 milestone report approved (profiles, mapping, upsert decision, fixtures) — 2026-08-28 |
| Next gate | L3 milestone report form |
| AFK mode | off |

Per standing rule 19: work happens in a session opened in this project
directory (`~/Projects/almanac`). L0 is done: renamed to almanac
throughout, hooks/CI live and proven (a bad commit was physically
blocked), `src/core`/`src/shell` split in place per AR13.

<!-- Update this block after every completed gate. -->

## History

Renamed from `cal-stacean` on 2026-08-28 (directory and repo only —
internal references like the Cargo package name, binary name, and CI
workflow still say `cal-stacean` pending Phase 1 inventory and later
deliberate rename). Former scope was a Google Calendar gateway with a
hardcoded Vikunja webhook integration; Vikunja is no longer used and
that integration is dropped, though its event-mapping/upsert pattern
is kept as the template for Almanac's general mapping-profile design.
See `docs/SCOPE.md` for the full picture.

## Gates (enforced, live since L0)

Commits are blocked by `.githooks/pre-commit` (`core.hooksPath`,
runs `.claude/hooks/gates.sh`: fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, AR13
core/shell boundary check) and `.githooks/commit-msg` (requires
bracketed IDs, e.g. `[K5]` or `[meta]`) from any session or terminal.
The Claude Code PreToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/check-commit.sh`) is a
second layer. CI re-runs the same gates on every push; branch
protection on `main` requires the `gates` check.
