// VENDORED — do not edit here.
// Source: ~/Projects/kp-themes js/theme-core.js @kp-soft/themes v1.0.0, commit 237a471,
// copied verbatim on 2026-09-04. The commit gate compares everything below
// this header against the upstream file.

// The theme state, owned by the document rather than by either channel
// [AR5, AR6, TH26].
//
// The React hook used to keep the current theme and its subscriber list in
// module state. A plain <script> cannot reach a React module's closure, so
// on the comparison page the two pickers would each set the theme
// correctly and each fail to update the other's selection mark — on the
// very surface built to compare them.
//
// So: the truth is `document.documentElement.dataset.theme`, and a change
// is announced as one DOM event both channels listen to. Cross-tab
// following rides the same bus, because a `storage` event is translated
// into the same announcement.
//
// This file is plain ESM with no dependencies. React sits on top of it,
// not underneath.
